# Travel/Restaurant Review Website Project

## Project Overview
This project is a school assignment focused on creating a website centered around travel and restaurant reviews. The website allows users to leave reviews for various locations, check out recently visited places, and rate them.

## Features
- Submit reviews for travel destinations and restaurants.
- Display of recently visited locations.
- "Rate Me" button for quick rating of locations.

## Mobile Support
Currently, the website lacks proper support for mobile view. The layout and design are optimized for desktop browsing, and improvements for mobile responsiveness are planned for future updates.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement mobile-friendly design.
- Add filtering options for reviews.
- Improve overall UI/UX.

## Acknowledgments
This project is a work in progress and was created as part of a school assignment.
